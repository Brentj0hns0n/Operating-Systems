These programs were edited using code blocks and compiled and run from the terminal on a linux machine.

Use the following compilation arguments:
	gcc -pthread -w -o Assign3a Assign3a.c -lm

	gcc -pthread -w -o Assign3b Assign3b.c -lm

run the programs using 
	./Assign3a

	./Assign3b

running Assign3a multiple times will demonstrate the randomness of the results without using a semaphore.
